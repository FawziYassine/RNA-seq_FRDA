# 1.   Introduction

Here, I will discuss the clinical significance of the [Experiment Results](Results.md) regarding the endogenous antioxidants defense system in  FRDA, and the therapeutic potential of sulforaphane.

The authors in ([Napierala et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29125828)) have used fibroblast cell lines in their sequencing experiment. They should have used nerve or heart cells these cells are the most defective ones in Friedreich’s Ataxia (**FRDA**) disease. Even then, I am still able to find significantly differentiated genes between **FRDA** group (18 samples) and Control (**CTRL**) group (17 samples) in this experiment. Interestingly, antioxidant genes were downregulated in **FRDA** cells.

# 2.   The Antioxidant Defense System is Defective in **FRDA** 

During energy production, the oxidation of carbon-containing nutrients in the **Krebs cycle** and the Electron Transport Chain (**ETC**) inside the mitochondria causes the production of free radicals or Reactive Oxygen Species (**ROS**). These radicals result from the reduction of O2 with proteins in the mitochondrial membrane. Examples of free radicals are superoxide, hydroxylradical, and hydrogen peroxide.  

An endogenous cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress caused by free radicals is to increase the transcription of genes that express several non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants (phase II antioxidants), in addition to anti-inflammatory, and detoxification enzymes. Enzymatic antioxidants include Superoxide dismutase (**SOD**), Catalase (**CAT**), glutathione peroxidase (**GPx**) glutathione reductase (**GR**), heme oxygenase-1 (**HO-1**), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (**NQO1**). **SOD** can break down superoxide into hydrogen peroxide (**H2O2**) and oxygen. **CAT** works by converting **H2O2** into water and oxygen, using iron and manganese cofactors. It finishes up the detoxifiCation process started by **SOD**. **GPx** is a selenium-containing enzyme that helps break down **H2O2** into water. **GR** is a NADPH-dependent flavoprotein that catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to GSH.  

The production of free radicals is exacerbated in FRDA patients because of the frataxin protein deficiency which leads to defects in several mitochondrial functions including Iron–Sulfur Cluster (ISC) assembly. ISC deficiency results in profound deficiencies in the ETC complexes I, II, and III (e.g. ubiquinone and cytochrome-b), and in the Krebs cycle enzyme aconitase; all of which require ISC for electron transfer catalysis (Paupe et al., 2009). This increases ROS production which accounts for the increased susceptibility to oxidative stress.

What makes matters worse for **FRDA** patients is that their endogenous cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress is defective in three major ways: 1) The **Nrf2** pathway, 2) The **Glutathione** homeostasis, and 3) The **PGC-1α** and **mitochondrial biogenesis** pathways.  
  
# 3.   Experiment Results Regarding Antioxidant Genes

The analysis of this experiment showed that in comparison with the **CTRL** group, the **FRDA** group showed a direct and significant downregulation of two antioxidant genes: **NQO1**, **TXN2** and **PRKAG1**. The downregulation of **PRKAG1** leads to the downregulation of several other antioxidant genes (like **SOD** and **HO-1**) because **PRKAG1**  is involved in their expression.  
Moreover, **PRKAG1** encodes one of three subunits of the enzyme **AMPK** (Adenosine 5′ Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase). **AMPK** plays a role in cellular energy homeostasis. Studies have shown 	that **AMPK** increases the production of certain antioxidant proteins, including **Nrf2**, **SOD**, **HO-1**, **NRF1** (Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1), and **PGC-1α**  (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 α) (Joo et al., 2016; Kukidome et al., 2006).  

 **PGC-1α** induces antioxidant genes in neurons as well. The authors in (Zhao et al., 2011) used a targeted overexpression of **PGC-1α** in neurons of SOD1 transgenic mice. This significantly improved motor performance and the authors asserted that these changes were due to the restoration of mitochondrial activities. **PGC-1α** is down-regulated in most cell types from **FRDA** patients and this likely to contribute to the blunted antioxidant response observed in cells from these patients. Marmalino D. et al. (Marmolino et al., 2010) experimented with fibroblasts from **FRDA** patients and the knock-in-knock-out animal model for the disease (KIKO mouse) to determine basal levels of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and the response to oxidative stress induced by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. They activated **PGC-1α** with the PPARγ agonist (Pioglitazone) or with a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) agonist (AICAR). This restored normal SOD2 induction. In fact, Pioglitazone significantly up-regulated SOD2 in the cerebellum and spinal cord.

**HO-1** attenuates endothelial cell apoptosis and decreases the superoxide anion by-products of oxidative phosphorylation and converts them to hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen.
**NQO1** is an enzyme that is encoded by the NQO1 gene. It is a 2-electron reductase that forms homodimers and performs two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones.  
**TXN2** is a member of the thioredoxin family, a group of small multifunctional redox-active proteins. The encoded protein may play important roles in the regulation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and in protection against oxidant-induced apoptosis.  
  
# 4.   The Therapuetic Potential of Sulforaphane

Not only the production of free radicals is exacerbated in **FRDA** patients because of **FXN** deficiency which leads to increased ROS production, but their endogenous cellular defense against oxidative stress is defective in three major mechanisms: 1) The **Nrf2** pathway, 2) The **Glutathione** homeostasis, and 3) The **PGC-1α** and mitochondrial biogenesis pathways.

Sulforaphane (**SFN**) which is a phytochemical found in Broccoli sprouts is able to correct these three defects, and this is shown in sections [2.1.1](https://biohackingfriedreichsataxia.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/FRDA-and-broccoli-sprouts/#2.1.1), [2.1.2](https://biohackingfriedreichsataxia.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/FRDA-and-broccoli-sprouts/#2.1.2) and [2.1.3](https://biohackingfriedreichsataxia.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/FRDA-and-broccoli-sprouts/#2.1.3) respectively in [my article](https://biohackingfriedreichsataxia.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/FRDA-and-broccoli-sprouts/) where I further highlight the genetic and other molecular mechanisms through which **SFN** might confer therapeutic benefits to **FRDA** patients. 

Moreover, sulforaphane has been shown to activate **AMPK** (Choi et al., 2014).
